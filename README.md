This contains typeset versions (i.e. passed through `cweave`) of programs written by Knuth, mainly for himself, available at <https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/programs.html> 

Collected here for those who are too lazy to install CWEB and run `cweave`, and who would otherwise attempt to read the `.w` files directly instead of reading them the way they are intended to be. :-)

This repository is a mess and I should clean it up sometime; but in the meantime the programs (as of 2017 or something) are available here: <https://github.com/shreevatsa/knuth-literate-programs/tree/master/programs> (TODO: Add some words about the conventions of CWEB or link to its manual.)

**Edit**: See also https://github.com/ascherer/cwebtest which is more up-to-date w.r.t. the programs: it has a `runall.sh` which you can use to generate the `.tex` files and then get PDFs out of them. Maybe I should change this repository to just use that. Some dayâ€¦
