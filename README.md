This repo contains the typeset versions (i.e. passed through `cweave`) of programs written by Knuth, mainly for himself, available on [his website](https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/programs.html). They are collected and typeset here for those who are too lazy to install CWEB and run `cweave`, and who would otherwise attempt to read the `.w` files directly instead of reading them the way they are intended to be. :-)

Look [at this webpage](https://shreevatsa.github.io/knuth-literate-programs/programs/) or manually in [this directory](https://github.com/shreevatsa/knuth-literate-programs/tree/master/programs).

(See also https://github.com/ascherer/cwebtest for downloading and building the programs.)
