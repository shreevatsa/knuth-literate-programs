# Misunderstandings about Literate Programming
What does Knuth mean by "literate programming"?

It is clearest if we look at actual examples.

Knuth has shared on [on his website](https://cs.stanford.edu/~uno/programs.html)
many examples of literate programs he wrote (mostly for himself). But they are
in the CWEB format (`.w` files), and people with only a passing curiosity (or
none) in literate programming may not take the trouble to download and run them
through `cweave` and `tex`, to read them the way they were intended to be read.

So I've done that here.
