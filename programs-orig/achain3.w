@*Intro. This program is a sequel to {\mc ACHAIN2}, which you should
read first. I'm experimenting with a brand-new way to find shortest
addition chains. Maybe it will be good, maybe not; but in either
case the results should be interesting (at least to me).
At the end of this program I shall discuss the observed running time.

The new idea is to generalize the problem to $l_k(n)$, the minimum length
of an addition chain for which $a_j=2^j$ for $0\le j\le k$,
assuming that $n\ge2^k$. Clearly $l_0(n)=l_1(n)=l(n)$ is the ordinary
function, and we have $l_k(n)\le l_{k+1}(n)$. Furthermore the
dual of the binary method (exercise 4.6.3--34) shows that
$l_k(n)\le\lfloor\lg n\rfloor+\nu n-1$. A slightly less obvious fact is
the inequality $l_{k+1}(2n)\le l_k(n)+1$; because if
1, 2, \dots, $2^k$, $a_{k+1}$, \dots,~$n$ is an addition chain, so is
1, 2, \dots, $2^k$, $2^{k+1}$, $2a_{k+1}$, \dots,~$2n$.

When I first thought of defining $l_k(n)$, I conjectured that
$l_{k+1}(n)\le l_k(n)+1$; but I'm tending to believe this less and less,
the more I think about it. If it fails, we would have
$l_{k+1}(n)>l_{k+1}(2n)$, by the previous inequality; but addition
chains are full of surprises.

[Indeed, Neill Clift found the counterexample $l_7(142025)=20$, $l_8(142025)=22$
in 2022!]

Two parameters are given on the given line. If they are \.{foo} and
\.{bar}, this program reads from files \.{foo-1}, \.{foo-2}, etc.,
and writes to files \.{bar-1}, \.{bar-2}, etc., with bytes of
the $k$th file giving values of $f_k(n)$ for $n=2^k$, $2^k+1$, $2^k+2$, etc.
An input file that doesn't exist, or that is too short to contain information
about the number $n$ being worked on, is simply disregarded; but if
data is present in an input file, it is believed to be true without
further checking.

@*The interesting part. 
The canonical-chain reduction of {\mc ACHAIN2} works for $l_k(n)$ as
well as for $l(n)$, because the first $k$ steps of an $l_k$~chain
are always reduced in the digraph. So I've taken it over here without
change.

Well, there is one change: In the former method, I started with a lower
bound and worked upward until achieving success;
now I'm going to start at an upper-bound-less-1 and continue until
failing (as in {\mc ACHAIN0}). This switch causes only minor
modifications, in spite of what I believed when I wrote {\mc ACHAIN1}.

At the top level, when $k=\lfloor\lg n\rfloor$, there's nothing to do,
because |ub| clearly contains the optimal value.
For smaller values of~$k$, we start at $l_{k+1}(n)-1$, and we
also set $b[k+1]\gets2^{k+1}-$, because we know that the value
$2^{k+1}$ has been ruled out.

@ The only change to this algorithm for {\mc ACHAIN2} occurs when we happen
to encounter an empty slot (namely when |outdeg[s]==0| and |s|
isn't the top level). Then we simply reject the current solution.
Reason: If it could be completed with the empty slot, that's great; but
we'll discover the fact later. Meanwhile there certainly are canonical
solutions with all slots nonempty, and they should be easy to find.

@<Make forced moves if |p| has a special form@>;

@ If, say, we've just set |a[8]=b[8]=132|, special considerations apply,
because the only addition chains of length~8 for 132 are
$$\eqalign{
&1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,132;\cr
&1,2,4,8,16,32,64,68,132;\cr
&1,2,4,8,16,32,64,66,132;\cr
&1,2,4,8,16,32,34,66,132;\cr
&1,2,4,8,16,32,33,66,132;\cr
&1,2,4,8,16,17,33,66,132.\cr}$$
The values of |a[4]| and |b[4]| must therefore be 16; and then, of course,
we also must have |a[3]=b[3]=8|, etc. Similar reasoning applies
whenever we set $a[j]=b[j]=2^j+2^k$ for $k\le j-4$.

Such cases may seem extremely special. But they are especially
useful in ruling out cases that have no good $l_k(n)$.

@ The bottom line: Alas, this method turns out to be by far the
slowest of all. But maybe somebody will find a use for it?
The most interesting thing I noticed is that $l_1(n)=l_2(n)$
for $4\le n<14759$; in other words, when $n$ is small there's
always a way to get by without using `3' in the chain.
But all four addition chains of length 17 for $n=14759$
start with 1,~2,~3. For example, one of them is
1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 13, 23, 46, 92, 184, 368, 736, 1472, 2944, 2957, 5901, 8858,
14759.

(I learned subsequently that Sch\"onhage had conjectured $l_1(n)=l_2(n)$
in 1975. Moreover, Bleichenbacher and Flammenkamp mentioned
the first three counterexamples in an unpublished preprint of 1997.
In fact, the counterexample $n=38587$ had actually been found already
by Tsai and Chin in 1992 [{\sl Proc.\ Nat.\ Sci.\ Council\/ \bf A16}
(Taiwan:\ 1992), 506--514].)
