@*Intro. This is a filter that inputs the format used by {\mc SAT0},
{\mc SAT1}, etc., and outputs the well-known DIMACS format for
satisfiability problems.

DIMACS format begins with zero or more optional comment lines, indicated by
their first character `\.c'. The next line should say `\.p \.{cnf} $n$ $m$',
where $n$ is the number of variables and $m$ is the number of clauses.
Then comes a string of $m$ ``clauses,'' which are sequences of
nonzero integers of absolute value $\le n$, followed by zero.
A literal for the $k$th variable is represented by $k$; its complement
is represented by $-k$.

SAT format is more flexible, more symbolic, and more complicated; it is
explained in the programs cited above. I hacked this program from {\mc SAT3}.

@c

int verbose=1; /* level of verbosity */
int hbits=8; /* logarithm of the number of the hash lists */
int buf_size=1024; /* must exceed the length of the longest input line */

@ On the command line one can say
\smallskip
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.v$\langle\,$integer$\,\rangle$' to enable various levels of verbose
 output on |stderr|;
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.h$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' to adjust the hash table size;

`\.b$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' to adjust the size of the input
buffer; and/or
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.s$\langle\,$integer$\,\rangle$' to define the seed for any random numbers
that are used.

@*The I/O wrapper. The following routines read the input and absorb it into
temporary data areas from which all of the ``real'' data structures
can readily be initialized. My intent is to incorporate these routines in all
of the SAT-solvers in this series. Therefore I've tried to make the code
short and simple, yet versatile enough so that almost no restrictions are
placed on the sizes of problems that can be handled. These routines are
supposed to work properly unless there are more than
$2^{32}-1=4$,294,967,295 occurrences of literals in clauses,
or more than $2^{31}-1=2$,147,483,647 variables or clauses.

In these temporary tables, each variable is represented by four things:
its unique name; its serial number; the clause number (if any) in which it has
most recently appeared; and a pointer to the previous variable (if any)
with the same hash address. Several variables at a time
are represented sequentially in small chunks of memory called ``vchunks,''
which are allocated as needed (and freed later).

@d vars_per_vchunk 341 /* preferably $(2^k-1)/3$ for some $k$ */

@<Type...@>=
typedef union {
  char ch8[8];
  uint u2[2];
  long long lng;
} octa;
typedef struct tmp_var_struct {
  octa name; /* the name (one to eight ASCII characters) */
  uint serial; /* 0 for the first variable, 1 for the second, etc. */
  int stamp; /* |m| if positively in clause |m|; |-m| if negatively there */
  struct tmp_var_struct *next; /* pointer for hash list */
} tmp_var;
@#
typedef struct vchunk_struct {
  struct vchunk_struct *prev; /* previous chunk allocated (if any) */
  tmp_var var[vars_per_vchunk];
} vchunk;

@ Each clause in the temporary tables is represented by a sequence of
one or more pointers to the |tmp_var| nodes of the literals involved.
A negated literal is indicated by adding~1 to such a pointer.
The first literal of a clause is indicated by adding~2.
Several of these pointers are represented sequentially in chunks
of memory, which are allocated as needed and freed later.

@d cells_per_chunk 511 /* preferably $2^k-1$ for some $k$ */

@<Type...@>=
typedef struct chunk_struct {
  struct chunk_struct *prev; /* previous chunk allocated (if any) */
  tmp_var *cell[cells_per_chunk];
} chunk;

@ @<Initialize everything@>=

for (h=0;h<1<<hbits;h++) hash[h]=NULL;

@ The hash address of each variable name has $h$ bits, where $h$ is the
value of the adjustable parameter |hbits|.
Thus the average number of variables per hash list is $n/2^h$ when there
are $n$ different variables. A warning is printed if this average number
exceeds 10. (For example, if $h$ has its default value, 8, the program will
suggest that you might want to increase $h$ if your input has 2560
different variables or more.)

All the hashing takes place at the very beginning,
and the hash tables are actually recycled before any SAT-solving takes place;
therefore the setting of this parameter is by no means crucial. But I didn't
want to bother with fancy coding that would determine $h$ automatically.
