@*Intro. This program is part of a family of ``SAT-solvers'' that I'm putting
together for my own education as I prepare to write Section 7.2.2.2 of
{\sl The Art of Computer Programming}. My intent is to have a variety of
compatible programs on which I can run experiments to learn how different
approaches work in practice.

I'm hoping that this one, which has the lucky number {\mc SAT13},
will be the fastest of all, on a majority of the
example satisfiability problems that I've been exploring.
Why? Because it is based on the ``modern'' ideas of so-called
{\it conflict driven clause learning\/} (CDCL) solvers. This approach,
pioneered notably by Sakallah and Marques-Silva ({\mc GRASP}) and
by Moskewicz, Madigan, Zhao, Zhang, Malik ({\mc CHAFF}), has reportedly
revolutionized the field, making {\mc SAT}-solvers applicable to large-scale
industrial problems.

My model for {\mc SAT13} has been E\'en and S\"orensson's MiniSAT solver,
together with Biere's PicoSAT solver, both of which were at one
time representative of world-class CDCL implementations. The technology has
continued to improve, and to become more complex than appropriate for
my book to survey; therefore I have not added all the latest bells and whistles.
But I think this program decently represents the main CDCL paradigms.

If you have already read {\mc SAT10} (or some other program of this
series), you might as well skip now past all the code for the
``I/O wrapper,'' because you have seen it before.

The input on |stdin| is a series of lines with one clause per line. Each
clause is a sequence of literals separated by spaces. Each literal is
a sequence of one to eight ASCII characters between \.{!} and \.{\}},
inclusive, not beginning with \.{\~},
optionally preceded by \.{\~} (which makes the literal ``negative'').
For example, Rivest's famous clauses on four variables,
found in 6.5--(13) and 7.1.1--(32) of {\sl TAOCP}, can be represented by the
following eight lines of input:
$$\chardef~=`\~
\vcenter{\halign{\tt#\cr
x2 x3 ~x4\cr
x1 x3 x4\cr
~x1 x2 x4\cr
~x1 ~x2 x3\cr
~x2 ~x3 x4\cr
~x1 ~x3 ~x4\cr
x1 ~x2 ~x4\cr
x1 x2 ~x3\cr}}$$
Input lines that begin with \.{\~\ } are ignored (treated as comments).
The output will be `\.{\~}' if the input clauses are unsatisfiable.
Otherwise it will be a list of noncontradictory literals that cover each
clause, separated by spaces. (``Noncontradictory'' means that we don't
have both a literal and its negation.) The input above would, for example,
yield `\.{\~}'; but if the final clause were omitted, the output would
be `\.{\~x1} \.{\~x2} \.{x3}', in some order, possibly together
with either \.{x4} or \.{\~x4} (but not both). No attempt is made to
find all solutions; at most one solution is given.

The running time in ``mems'' is also reported, together with the approximate
number of bytes needed for data storage. One ``mem'' essentially means a
memory access to a 64-bit word.
(These totals don't include the time or space needed to parse the
input or to format the output.)

@ So here's the structure of the program. (Skip ahead if you are
impatient to see the interesting stuff.)

@ On the command line one can specify any or all of the following options:
\smallskip
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.v$\langle\,$integer$\,\rangle$' to enable various levels of verbose
 output on |stderr|.
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.c$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' to limit the levels on which
choices are shown by |show_choices|.
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.H$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' to limit the literals whose
histories are shown by |print_state|.
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.h$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' to adjust the hash table size.
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.b$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' to adjust the size of the input
buffer.
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.s$\langle\,$integer$\,\rangle$' to define the seed for any random numbers
that are used.
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.d$\langle\,$integer$\,\rangle$' to set |delta| for periodic state reports
(default 10000000000). (See |print_state|.)
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.D$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' to set |doomsday|, the
number of conflicts after which this world comes to an end.
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.m$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' to adjust the maximum memory size.
(The binary logarithm is specified; it must be at most 31.)
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.t$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' to adjust |trivial_limit| (default
10). A trivial clause is substituted for a learned clause when the size of the
latter is at least |trivial_limit| more than the size of the former.
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.w$\langle\,$integer$\,\rangle$' to set |warmups|, the number of ``full runs''
done after a restart (default 0).
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.f$\langle\,$positive float$\,\rangle$' to adjust |restart_psi_fraction|, the
minimum agility threshold between automatically scheduled restarts
(default 0.05).
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.j$\langle\,$integer$\,\rangle$' to adjust |recycle_bump|, the number of
conflicts before the first recycling pass (default 1000).
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.J$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' to adjust |recycle_inc|, the
increase in number of conflicts between recycling passes (default 500).
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.a$\langle\,$float$\,\rangle$' to adjust |alpha|, the weight given to
unsatisfied levels when computing a clause's score during the recycling
process (default 0.4). This parameter must be between 0 and 1.
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.r$\langle\,$positive float$\,\rangle$' to adjust |var_rho|, the
damping factor for variable activity scores.
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.R$\langle\,$positive float$\,\rangle$' to adjust |clause_rho|, the
damping factor for clause activity scores.
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.p$\langle\,$nonnegative float$\,\rangle$' to adjust |rand_prob|, the
probability that a branch variable is chosen randomly.
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.P$\langle\,$nonnegative float$\,\rangle$' to adjust |true_prob|, the
probability that a variable's default initial value is true.
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.x$\langle\,$filename$\,\rangle$' to output a
solution-eliminating clause to the specified file. If the given problem is
satisfiable in more than one way, a different solution can be obtained by
appending that file to the input. (In principle, all solutions could be
found by repeated use of this feature, together with a restart file.)
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.l$\langle\,$filename$\,\rangle$' to output all of the learned clauses
of length $\le |learn_save|$
to the specified file. (This data can be used, for example, as a certificate
of unsatisfiability.)
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.K$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' to adjust the |learn_save|
parameter (default 10000).
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.L$\langle\,$filename$\,\rangle$' to output some learned clauses
to the specified file, for purposes of restarting after doomsday. (Those
clauses can be combined with the original clauses and simplified by
a preprocessor.)
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.z$\langle\,$filename$\,\rangle$' to input a ``polarity file,'' which is
a list of literals that receive specified default values to be used
until forced otherwise. (Literals in this file whose names do not appear
within any of the input clauses are ignored.)
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.Z$\langle\,$filename$\,\rangle$' to output a ``polarity file'' that will
be suitable for restarting after doomsday.
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.T$\langle\,$integer$\,\rangle$' to set |timeout|: This program will
abruptly terminate, when it discovers that |mems>timeout|.

@*The I/O wrapper. The following routines read the input and absorb it into
temporary data areas from which all of the ``real'' data structures
can readily be initialized. My intent is to incorporate these routines into all
of the SAT-solvers in this series. Therefore I've tried to make the code
short and simple, yet versatile enough so that almost no restrictions are
placed on the sizes of problems that can be handled. These routines are
supposed to work properly unless there are more than
$2^{32}-1=4$,294,967,295 occurrences of literals in clauses,
or more than $2^{31}-1=2$,147,483,647 variables or clauses.

In these temporary tables, each variable is represented by four things:
its unique name; its serial number; the clause number (if any) in which it has
most recently appeared; and a pointer to the previous variable (if any)
with the same hash address. Several variables at a time
are represented sequentially in small chunks of memory called ``vchunks,''
which are allocated as needed (and freed later).

exceeds 10. (For example, if $h$ has its default value, 8, the program will
suggest that you might want to increase $h$ if your input has 2560
different variables or more.)

All the hashing takes place at the very beginning,

therefore the setting of this parameter is by no means crucial. But I didn't

@*SAT solving, version 13.
The methods used in this program have much in common with what we've
seen before in {\mc SAT0}, {\mc SAT1}, etc.; yet conflict-driven
clause learning is also rather different. So we might as well derive everything
from first principles.

As usual, our goal is to find strictly distinct literals that satisfy
all of the given clauses, or to prove that those clauses can't all be
satisfied. Thus our subgoal, after having created a ``trail'' $l_0l_1\ldots l_t$
of literals that don't falsify any clause, will be to extend that sequence
until finding a solution, and to do this without failing unless no
solution exists.

If there's a clause $c$ of the form $l\lor\bar a_1\lor\cdots\lor\bar a_k$,
where $a_1$ through~$a_k$ are in the trail but $l$ isn't, we append~$l$
to the trail and say that $c$ is its ``reason.'' This operation, often
called unit propagation, is basic to our program; we shall simply call
it {\it forcing}. (We're forced to make $l$ true, if $a_1$ through $a_k$
are true, because $c$ must be satisfied.) A {\it conflict\/} occurs
if the complementary literal $\bar l$ is already in the trail,
because $l$ can't be both true and false;
but let's assume for now that no conflicts arise.

If no such forcing clause exists, and if the clauses aren't all satisfied,
we choose a new distinct literal in some heuristic way, and append it to
the trail with a ``reason'' of~0. Such literals are called {\it decisions}.
They partition the trail into a sequence of decision levels, with
literal $l_j$ belonging to level~$d$ if and only if $i_d\le j< i_{d+1}$.
In general $0\le i_1<i_2<\cdots{}$; and we also define $i_0=0$.
(Level~0 is special; it contains literals that are forced by clauses of
length~1, if such clauses exist. Any such literals are unconditionally true.
Every other level begins with exactly one decision.)

\def\sucp{\mathrel{{\succ}\!^+}}
If the reason for $l$ includes the literal $\bar l'$, we say
``$l$ depends directly on~$l'$,'' and we write $l\succ l'$.
And if there's a chain of one or more direct dependencies
$l\succ l_1\succ\cdots\succ l_k=l'$, we write $l\sucp l'$ and
say simply that ``$l$ depends on~$l'$.'' For example, given the
three clauses $a$ and $\bar a\lor b$ and $\bar b\lor\bar c\lor d$,
we might begin the trail with $l_0l_1l_2l_3=abcd$, where the first clause
is the reason for~$a$, the second clause is the reason for~$b$, and the
third clause is the reason for~$d$, while $c$ is a decision.
Then $d\succ c$ and $d\succ b$ and $b\succ a$; hence $d\sucp a$.

Notice that a literal can depend only on literals that precede it in the trail.
Furthermore,
every literal $l$ that's forced at level $d>0$ depends directly on some
{\it other\/} literal on that same level; hence $l$ must necessarily
depend on the $d\,$th decision.

The reason for reasons is that we need to deal with conflicts. We will see
that every conflict allows us to construct a new clause~$c$ that must be
true whenever the existing clauses are satisfiable, although $c$ itself
does not contain any existing clause. Therefore we can ``learn''~$c$ by
adding it to the existing clauses, and we can try again. This learning
process can't go on forever, because only finitely many clauses are possible.
Sooner or later we will therefore either find a solution or learn the
empty clause.

A conflict clause $c_d$ on decision level~$d$ has the form
$\bar l\lor\bar a_1\lor\cdots\lor\bar a_k$, where $l$ and all the $a$'s
belong to the trail; furthermore $l$ and at least one $a_i$ belong to
level~$d$. We can assume that $l$ is rightmost in the trail,
of all the literals in $c_d$.
Hence $l$ cannot be the $d\,$th decision; and it has a
reason, say $l\lor\bar a'_1\lor\cdots\lor\bar a'_{k'}$. Resolving $c_d$
with this reason gives the clause $c=\bar a_1\lor\cdots\lor\bar a_k\lor\bar
a'_1\lor\cdots\lor\bar a'_{k'}$, which includes at least one literal~$\bar l'$
for which $l'$ is on level~$d$. If more than one such literal is present,
we can resolve $c$ with the reason of a rightmost~$l'$;
the result will involve negations of literals that are still further
to the left. By repeating this process we'll eventually obtain
$c$ of the form $\bar l'\lor\bar b_1\lor\cdots\lor\bar b_r$, where
$l'$ is on level~$d$ and where $b_1$ through~$b_r$ are on lower levels.

Such a $c$ is learnable, as desired, because it can't contain any
existing clause. (Every subclause of~$c$, including $c$ itself,
would have given us something to
force at a lower level.) We can now discard levels $>d'$ of the trail, where
$d'$ is the maximum level of $b_1$ through $b_r$; and we append
$\bar l'$ to the end of level~$d'$, with $c$ as its reason.
The forcing process now resumes at level~$d'$, as if the learned
clause had been present all along.

Okay, that's the basic idea of conflict-driven clause learning.
Many other issues will come up as we refine it, of course. For example,
we'll see that the clause $c$ can often be simplified by removing
one or more of its literals~$\bar b_i$. And we'll want to ``unlearn'' clauses
that outlive their usefulness.

@ What data structures support this procedure? We obviously need to
represent the trail, as well as the levels, the values, and the reasons for
each of its literals.

A principal concern is to make forcing as fast as possible. Many
applications involve numerous binary clauses (that is, clauses of length~2);
and binary clauses make forcing quite easy. So we should have a
special mechanism to derive binary implications quickly.

Long clauses are also important. (Even if they aren't common in the input,
the clauses that we learn may well turn out to involve dozens of literals.)
``Watch lists'' provide a good way to recognize when such clauses
become ready for forcing: We choose two literals in each long clause,
neither of which is false, and we pay no attention to that clause until one of
its watched literals becomes false. In the latter case, we'll be able to
watch it with another literal, unless the clause has become true or it's ready
to force something. (We've used a similar idea, but with only one watched
literal per clause, in {\mc SAT0W} and {\mc SAT10}.)

We'll want a good heuristic for choosing the decision literals.
This program adopts the strategy of E\'en and S\"orensson's
MiniSAT, which associates a floating-point {\it activity\/}
score with each variable, and uses a heap to choose the most
active variable.

Learned clauses also have a measure of clause quality devised by Gilles Audemard
and Laurent Simon. The original clauses are static and stay in place,
but we must periodically decide which of the learned clauses to keep.

@ Binary clauses $u\lor v$ are represented by putting $v$ into a list
associated with $\bar u$ and $u$ into a list associated with $\bar v$.
These ``binary implication'' lists are created once and for all at the
beginning of the run, as explained below.

Longer clauses (and binary clauses that are learned later) are
represented in a big array |mem| of 32-bit integers. (Entries of |mem|
are often called ``cells'' in this documentation.) The literals
of clause~|c| are |mem[c].lit|, |mem[c+1].lit|, |mem[c+2].lit|, etc.;
the first two of these are ``watching''~$c$. The number of literals,
|size(c)|, is |mem[c-1].lit|; and we keep links to other clauses
being watched by the same literals in |link0(c)=mem[c-2].lit| and
|link1(c)=mem[c-3].lit|.

(Incidentally, this linked structure for watch lists was originally introduced
in PicoSAT by Armin Biere [{\sl Journal on Satisfiability, Boolean Modeling
and Computation\/ \bf4} (2008), 75--97]. Nowadays the fastest solvers
use a more complicated mechanism called ``blocking literals,'' due to Niklas
S\"orensson, which is faster because it is more cache friendly. However,
I'm sticking to linked lists, because (1)~they don't need dynamic storage
allocation of sequential arrays; (2)~they use fewer memory accesses; and
(3)~on modern multithreaded machines they can be implemented so as to avoid the
cache misses, by starting up threads whose sole purpose is to preload the
link-containing cells into the cache. I~expect that software to facilitate
such transformations will be widely available before long.)

Sometimes we learn that a clause can be strengthened by removing
one of its literals. In such cases we add |sign_bit| to the surplus
literal, swap it to the end of the clause, and decrease the |size| field.
Except for such deleted literals, the sign bit of every cell in |mem| should
be zero. (The earliest cell of a learned clause~|c| is the nonnegative
floating-point value |activ(c)|.
The final clause should be followed by a zero cell,
so that garbage at the end isn't confused with a deleted literal.)

If |c| is the current reason for literal |l|, its first literal
|mem[c].lit| is always equal to |l|. This condition makes it easy
to tell if a given clause plays an important role in the current trail.

A learned clause is identifiable by the condition |c>=min_learned|.
Such clauses have additional information,
|range(c)=mem[c-4].lit| and |activ(c)=mem[c-5].flt|,
which will help us decide whether
or not to keep them after memory has begun to fill up.

Several different kinds of data are maintained for each variable:
its eight-character |name|; its |activity| score (used to indicate
relative desirability for being chosen to make the next decision);
its current |value|, which also encodes the level at which
the value was set; its current location, |tloc|, in the trail;
and its current location, |hloc|, in the heap
(which is used to find a maximum activity score). There's also
|oldval| and |stamp|, which will be explained later.

@ The |print_stats| subroutine presents a digest of the current goings-on.
First it shows the number of literals learned at level~zero~(\.z).
Then it shows recent smoothed-average values of decision depth~(\.d),
trail length~(\.t),
mems per conflict~(\.m),
propagations per conflict~(\.p),
resolutions per conflict~(\.r),
literals per learned clause~(\.L and
\.l, where the latter is restricted to nontrivial clauses),
glucose per learned clause (\.g), and
clauses of length six~or~less per learned clause (\.s),
together with the recent agility~(\.a). For my own edification
I also estimate mems per propagation~(\.{m/p}).

the value of~$x$ at the $k$-from-last conflict, and $\zeta$ is the
damping factor $1-2^{-7}$.

Thus, to update $\sigma$ with a new value of $x$ at conflict time,
we replace it by $\zeta\sigma+2^{32}x/(1+\zeta+\zeta^2+\cdots{})=

@ In long runs it's helpful to know how far we've gotten. A numeric code
summarizes the histories of literals that appear in the current trail:
0 or 1 means that we're trying to set a variable
true or false, as a decision at the beginning of a level;
2 or 3 is similar, but after we've learned that the decision was wrong (hence
we've learned a clause that has forced the opposite decision);
4 or 5 is similar, but when the value was forced by
the decision at the previous decision node;
6 or 7 is similar, but after we learned that a previous decision
forces this one. (In the latter case, the learned clause forced a
variable that was not the decision variable at its level.)
This code is also used for unit clauses in the input.

A special |history| array is used to provide these base codes (0, 2, 4, or 6).
No mems are assessed for maintaining |history|, because it isn't used
in any decisions taken by the algorithm; it's purely for diagnostic purposes.

The variable |trail_marker| marks a place in the trail that I'm trying
to study. This subroutine inserts a vertical line at that point, so that
I can watch where it goes. (Maybe other users might even find it informative
some day, who knows?)

Note: These codes are analogous to similar codes in {\mc SAT0}, {\mc SAT0W},
{\mc SAT10}, and {\mc SAT11}. But they don't really give an easy-to-read
picture of progress, as they did in the others, because they don't increase
lexicographically in the presence of restarts. Therefore they are
displayed only if the user has set |print_state_cutoff| to a positive
value, using the command-line parameter~\.H.

via \.m on the command line. (Apology: This program is for my own use in
experiments, so I haven't bothered to give it a more user-friendly interface.)

It will begin with data for all clauses of length 3 or more;
then come the learned clauses, which have slightly longer preambles.
During the initialization, some of the eventual space for learned
clauses is used temporarily to hold the binary clause information.

We will record in |bytes| and |max_cells_used| only the number of cells actually
utilized; this at least gives the user some clue about how big \.m should be.

to the current trail when they are forced to be true because of
earlier items on the trail.

consequences of literal~|l| that follow from binary clauses in the
input. At this point |l| is a literal in the trail.
Furthermore |lat=lmem[l].bimp_end|
has just been fetched, and it's known to be nonzero.

(I apologize for the awkward interface between this loop and its context.
Maybe I shouldn't worry so much about saving mems in the inner loop.
But that's the kind of guy I~am.)

the more complex ones, by looking at all clauses on the watch

While doing this, we swap the first two literals, if necessary, so that

either |mem[c].lit| and |mem[c+1].lit| are in the same octabyte,

@*Activity scores.
Experience shows that it's usually a good idea to branch on a variable that
has participated recently in the construction of conflict clauses. More
precisely, we try to maximize ``activity,'' where the activity of variable~$v$
is proportional to the sum of $\{\rho^t\mid v$ participates in the
$t\,$th-from-last conflict$\}$; here $\rho$ is a parameter representing
the rate of decay by which influential activity decays with time.
(Users can change the default ratio $\rho=.95$ if desired.)

There's a simple way to implement this quantity, because activity is
also proportional to the sum of $\{\rho^{-t}\mid v$ participates in the
$t\,$th conflict$\}$; that sum counts forward in time rather than backward.
We can therefore get proper results by adding |var_bump| to $v$'s score
whenever $v$ participates in a conflict, and then dividing |var_bump|
by~$\rho$ after each conflict.

If the activity scores computed in this way become too large, we simply
scale them back, so that relative ratios are preserved.

Incidentally, the somewhat mysterious acronym {\mc VSIDS}, which
stands for ``variable state independent decaying sum,'' is often
used by insiders to describe this aspect of a CDCL solver. The
activity scoring mechanism adopted here, due to Niklas E\'en
in the 2005 version of MiniSAT, was inspired by a
similar but less effective {\mc VSIDS} scheme originally introduced
by Matthew Moskewitz in the {\mc CHAFF} solver.

@*Learning from a conflict.
A conflict arises when some clause is found to have no true literals
at the current level. This program relies on a technique for avoiding
such a conflict in the future,
by creating a new clause that is worth learning. Our current
goal is to implement (and thereby to understand) that technique.

Let's say that a literal is ``new'' if it has become true or false at
the current decision level; otherwise it is ``old.'' A conflict must
contain at least two new literals, because we don't start a new level
until every unsatisfied clause is watched by two unassigned literals.

(Hedge: In a ``full run'' we march boldly into deeper levels after
finding conflicts; and in such cases the conflict clauses of level~$d$
are watched by two literals that are false at level~$d$. However,
even in this case, every unsatisfied clause that could lead to a
conflict at a deeper level is watched by two unassigned literals.)

Suppose all literals of $c$ are false. If $\bar l\in c$ and $c'$ is the
reason for $l$, we can resolve $c$ with~$c'$ to get a new clause~$c''$.
This clause~$c''$ is obtained from~$c$ by deleting~$\bar l$ and
then inserting $\bar l'$ for all $l'$ such that $l\succ l'$. (Indeed,
when introducing the method of conflict-driven clause learning above,
we defined this direct dependency relation by saying that $l\succ l'$ if and
only if $\bar l'$ appears in the reason for~$l$.)
Notice that all of the literals that belong to $c''$ are false;
hence $c''$, like~$c$, represents a conflict.

By starting with a conflict clause $c$ and repeatedly
resolving away its rightmost literal, using the ordering of the trail,
we'll eventually obtain
a clause~$c_0$ that has only one new literal. And if $c_0$ was derived by
resolving with other clauses $c_1$, \dots,~$c_k$, the old literals of $c_0$
will be the old literals of $c$, $c_1$, \dots,~$c_k$.

We could now learn the clause $c_0$, and return to decision level~$d$,
the maximum of the levels of $c_0$'s old literals. (Its new literal
will now be forced false at that level.)

Actually, we'll try to simplify $c_0$ before learning it,
by removing some of its old literals if they are redundant. But that's
another story, which we can safely postpone until later. The main idea
is this: Starting with a conflict clause~$c$, containing two or more new
literals, we boil it down to a clause~$c_0$ that contains only one.
Then we can resume at a previous level.

@ So much for theory; let's proceed to practice. We can use the |stamp|
field to identify literals that appear in the conflict clause~$c$, or in the
clauses derived from~$c$ as we compute~$c_0$: A variable's |stamp| will
equal |curstamp| if and only if we have just marked it.

@ Here now is the technique of ``on-the-fly subsumption,'' which allows us
to strengthen the clause |c| because it happens to contain the current
conflict clause.
[This technique was discovered by Han and Somenzi in America, and
independently by Hamadi, Jabbour, and Sa{\"\i}s in Europe,
both in 2009!]

The current conflict has been obtained by resolving |c| with another clause,
and by removing literals that are false at level~0. We've also removed
such literals from~|c|. Therefore we know that the current conflict clause
equals |c| minus its first literal (which is true and was resolved away).

Clause |c| is the reason for |l|, and it becomes the reason for a
false literal that would have produced an earlier conflict.
(That false literal must have become false at the current trail level.)
We don't have to update the reason data, because backtracking will
clear it out before it will be needed.

There are strange scenarios in which |c=prev_learned| and the newly
learned clause might duplicate the previous one. The previous one
won't be removed unless we now happen to be watching the literal that will
later be called |bar(lll)|.

@*Simplifying the learned clause.
Suppose the clause to be learned is $\bar l\lor\bar a_1\lor\cdots\lor\bar a_k$.
Many of the literals $\bar a_j$ often turn out to be redundant, in the sense
that a few well-chosen resolutions will remove them.

For example, if the reason of $a_4$ is $a_4\lor\bar a_1\lor\bar b_1$ and
the reason of~$b_1$ is $b_1\lor\bar a_2\lor\bar b_2$ and the reason of~$b_2$
is $b_2\lor\bar a_1\lor\bar a_3$, then $\bar a_4$ is redundant.

Niklas S\"orensson, one of the authors of MiniSAT, noticed that learned
clauses could typically be shortened by 30\% when such simplifications are
made. Therefore we certainly want to look for removable literals, even though
the algorithm for doing so is somewhat tricky.

The literal $\bar a$ is redundant in the clause-to-be-learned if and only if
the other literals in its reason are either present in that clause
or (recursively) redundant. (In the example above we must check that
$\bar a_1$ and $\bar b_1$ satisfy this condition; that boils down to
observing that $\bar b_1$ is redundant, because $\bar b_2$ is redundant.)

Since the relation $\sucp$ is a partial ordering, we can determine
redundancy by using a ``bottom up'' method with this recursive definition.
Or we can go ``top down'' with memoization (which is what we'll do):
We shall stamp a literal $b$ with |curstamp+1| if $\bar b$ is known to
be redundant, and with |curstamp+2| if $\bar b$ is known to be nonredundant.
Once we know a literal's status, we won't need to apply the recursive
definition again.

A nice trick (also due to S\"orensson) can be used to speed this process up,
using the fact that a non-decision literal always depends on at least one
other literal at the same level: A literal $\bar a_j$ can be redundant
only if it shares a level with some other literal $\bar a_i$ in the
learned clause. Furthermore, a literal $\bar b$ not in that clause can be
redundant only if it shares a level with some~$\bar a_j$.

A careful reader of the code in the previous sections will have noticed
that we've set |levstamp[t+t]=curstamp| if level~|t| contains exactly one
of the literals $\bar a_j$, and we've set |levstamp[t+t]=curstamp+1|
if it contains more than one. Those facts will help us decide non-redundancy
without pursuing the whole recursion into impossible levels.

@ Instead of doing this computation with a recursive procedure, I want
to control the counting of memory accesses, and to take advantage of
the special logical structure that's present. So the program here uses an
explicit stack to hold the parameters of unfinished queries.

When we enter this section, |stackptr| will be zero (it says here).
When we leave it, whether by going to |redundant| or not,
the original value of~|l| will be in~|ll|.
I~think this loop makes an instructive
example of how recursion relates to iteration.

One can prove inductively that, at label |test|, we have
|vmem[thevar(l)].stamp<=curstamp|, with equality if and only if |stackptr=0|.

}
goto redundant;
@<Clear the stack@>;

@ If any of the literals we encounter during that recursive exploration
are non-redundant, the literal |ll| we're currently working on is
non-redundant, and so are all of the literals on the stack.

(The literal at the bottom of the stack belongs to the learned clause,
so we keep its stamp equal to |curstamp|. The other literals, whose
stamp was less than |curstamp|, are now marked with |curstamp+2|.)

@ Sometimes the learned clause turns out to be unnecessarily long even
after we simplify it. This can happen, for example, if the decision
literal~|l| on level~1 is not part of the clause, but all the other literals
have a reason that depends on~|l|; then no literal is redundant, by our
definitions, yet many literals can be from the same level.

If the learned clause size exceeds the jump level plus~|trivial_limit|, we
replace it
by a ``trivial'' clause based on decision literals only. (In such cases
we are essentially doing no better than an ordinary backtrack algorithm.)

@ The following code is used only when |learned_size>1|. (Learned
unit clauses are, of course, happy events; but we deal with them separately.)

The new clause must be watched by two literals. One literal in this
clause, namely~|lll|, was formerly false but it will become true.
It's the one that survived from the conflict
on the active level, and it will be one of the watchers we need.

All other literals in the learned clause are currently false. We must
choose one of those on the highest level (furthest from root level)
to be a watcher. For if we don't, backtracking might take us to
a lower level on which the clause becomes forcing, yet we won't
see that fact --- we won't be watching it! (The true literal and
an unwatched literal become unassigned during backtracking.
Then, if the unwatched literal
becomes false, we won't notice that the formerly true literal
is now forced true again.)

@*Recycling unhelpful clauses.
After thousands of conflicts have occurred, we have learned thousands of new
clauses. New clauses guide the search by steering us away from unproductive
paths; but they also slow down the propagation process because we have to
watch them.

Therefore we try to rank the clauses that have accumulated, and we
periodically attempt to weed out the ones that appear to be hurting us more
than they help.

This program assesses the utility of learned clauses by using a
heuristic measure of quality inspired by the paper of
Gilles Audemard and Laurent Simon in {\sl IJCAI\/ \bf21} (2009), 399-404.
Suppose the literals of clause |c| appear on exactly $p+q$ distinct levels of
the trail, where there's at least one true literal in $p$ of those levels,
but all literals of the other $q$ levels are false. Then we give |c| the
score $p+\alpha q$, called its ``range.''
Heuristically, this range will tend to be small if
|c| is going to participate in future forcing operations.

The parameter $\alpha$ equals 0.2 by default, but users can tune it to
their heart's content, as long as $0\le\alpha\le1$.
Audemard and Simon considered only the case $\alpha=1$
in their paper, calling $p+q$ the ``literal block distance'' of~|c|.
% they said "literals blocks distance" but improved it in 2011
Smaller values of~$\alpha$ appeared to give even better results, in
my early tests; however, I've had mixed results since then.
Certainly $\alpha=0$ is too small, because $p$ tends to have a limited range
and $q$~is needed to break ties. Similarly, I~think $\alpha=1$ is inadvisable,
because $p$~is needed to break ties in clauses with the same literal
block distance.

If a learned clause is currently used as the reason for some literal in the
trail, we must keep it: That clause is ``asserting.'' So we give it
range~0. (Except at root level.)

Armin Biere has advised me not to recycle clauses of size 3 or less.
But this program doesn't make any special provision for such clauses,
because they will almost surely stick around as a consequence of the
range heuristic.

Let's suppose that we
have accumulated $h$ learned clauses in~|mem|, and that we want
to reduce that number from $h$ to~$h/2$. We shall do that by retaining
those clauses whose range lies below the median range.

A precise determination of the median isn't necessary, because ranges are
only heuristic. We actually convert the range to an 8-bit number by computing
$\min\bigl(\lfloor16(p+\alpha q)\rfloor,255\bigr)$. (All ranges of 16 or more
are therefore considered to be equally bad.) Knowing the distribution of these
scaled ranges then makes it easy to select the smallest ones.

@ Each clause recycling pass is a major event, something like spring
cleaning. First we prepare to compute the ranges by doing a full run,
so that every variable has been assigned to a level and a tentative
Boolean value. Then we backtrack to level zero, possibly learning
new clauses as we go. (Any such clauses |c| will have |c>=recycle_point|;
they have no range, so we treat them as if they were asserted,
with range~zero.) And then we drastically reduce our database of
learned clauses, using this opportunity to remove clauses that are
permanently satisfied and to remove literals that are permanently false.
During this process the watch lists need to be dismantled and rebuilt.

Notice that the second step in this process, backtracking to level zero,
is very much like doing a restart. (The only difference is that
``warmup'' rounds are automatically scheduled after every true restart.)
Thus the decisions that are taken at levels 1, 2, \dots\ will not necessarily
match the decisions that were in force at those levels when we decided to
do a recycling pass.

I don't think that is a bad thing. However, we could recreate those
decisions if we wanted to, by doing the following when backtracking
past a decision literal~|l|: Set |l|'s activity to the currently largest
activity, which is the activity of the variable currently in |heap[0]|;
then bump it up, so that it becomes the new champion.

the trail. (That new variable will be the one with maximum activity, among all
