@*Intro. This program is part of a series of ``exact cover solvers'' that
I'm putting together for my own education as I prepare to write Section
7.2.2.1 of {\sl The Art of Computer Programming}. My intent is to
have a variety of compatible programs on which I can run experiments,
in order to learn how different approaches work in practice.

The basic input format for all of these solvers is described at the beginning
of program {\mc DLX1}, and you should read that description now if you are
unfamiliar with it.

{\mc DLX2} extends {\mc DLX1} by allowing ``color controls,'' which give
considerably more flexibility to nonprimary items: Any option that specifies
a ``color'' in a nonprimary item will rule out all options that don't
specify the same color for that item. But any number of options whose
nonprimary items agree in color are allowed. (The previous
situation was the special case in which every option corresponds to a
distinct color.)

The input format is extended so that, if \.{xx} is the name of a nonprimary
item, options can contain entries of the form \.{xx:a}, where \.a is
a single character (denoting a color).

Here, for example, is a simple test case:
$$
\vcenter{\halign{\tt#\cr
\char"7C\ A simple example of color controls\cr
A B C \char"7C\ X Y\cr
A B X:0 Y:0\cr
A C X:1 Y:1\cr
X:0 Y:1\cr
B X:1\cr
C Y:1\cr}}
$$
The option \.{X:0 Y:1} will be deleted, because it has no primary items.
The unique solution consists of options \.{A C X:1 Y:1} and \.{B X:1}.

If the input contains no color specifications, the behavior of {\mc DLX2}
will almost exactly match that of~{\mc DLX1}, except for having a
slightly longer program and taking a bit longer to input the options.

[{\it Historical note:\/} My first program for color-controlled exact
covering was {\mc GDANCE}, written in November 2000 when I was thinking
about two-dimensional de Bruijn sequences. Later I came gradually to
realize that the idea has many, many other applications. Indeed, in 2016
I~noticed that the general constraint satisfaction problem can actually
be regarded as a special case, when the allowable joint constraints are
explicitly~listed.]

@ After this program finds all solutions, it normally prints their total
number on |stderr|, together with statistics about how many
nodes were in the search tree, and how many ``updates'' and
``cleansings'' were made.
The running time in ``mems'' is also reported, together with the approximate
number of bytes needed for data storage.
(An ``update'' is the removal of an option from its item list.
A ``cleansing'' is the removal of a satisfied color constraint from its option.
One ``mem'' essentially means a memory access to a 64-bit word.
The reported totals don't include the time or space needed to parse the
input or to format the output.)

Here is the overall structure:

@d o mems++ /* count one mem */
@d oo mems+=2 /* count two mems */
@d ooo mems+=3 /* count three mems */
@d O "%" /* used for percent signs in format strings */
@d mod % /* used for percent signs denoting remainder in \CEE/ */

@d max_level 5000 /* at most this many options in a solution */
@d max_cols 100000 /* at most this many items */
@d max_nodes 10000000 /* at most this many nonzero elements in the matrix */

@ You can control the amount of output, as well as certain properties
of the algorithm, by specifying options on the command line:
\smallskip\item{$\bullet$}
`\.v$\langle\,$integer$\,\rangle$' enables or disables various kinds of verbose
 output on |stderr|, given by binary codes such as |show_choices|;
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.m$\langle\,$integer$\,\rangle$' causes every $m$th solution
to be output (the default is \.{m0}, which merely counts them);
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.s$\langle\,$integer$\,\rangle$' causes the algorithm to make
random choices in key places (thus providing some variety, although
the solutions are by no means uniformly random), and it also
defines the seed for any random numbers that are used;
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.d$\langle\,$integer$\,\rangle$' sets |delta|, which causes periodic
state reports on |stderr| after the algorithm has performed approximately
|delta| mems since the previous report (default 10000000000);
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.c$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' limits the levels on which
choices are shown during verbose tracing;
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.C$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' limits the levels on which
choices are shown in the periodic state reports;
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.l$\langle\,$nonnegative integer$\,\rangle$' gives a {\it lower\/} limit,
relative to the maximum level so far achieved, to the levels on which
choices are shown during verbose tracing;
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.t$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' causes the program to
stop after this many solutions have been found;
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.T$\langle\,$integer$\,\rangle$' sets |timeout| (which causes abrupt
termination if |mems>timeout| at the beginning of a level);
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.S$\langle\,$filename$\,\rangle$' to output a ``shape file'' that encodes
the search tree.

@*Data structures.
Each item of the input matrix is represented by an \&{item} struct,
and each option is represented as a list of \&{node} structs. There's one
node for each nonzero entry in the matrix.

More precisely, the nodes of individual options appear sequentially,
with ``spacer'' nodes between them. The nodes are also
linked circularly with respect to each item, in doubly linked lists.
The item lists each include a header node, but the option lists do not.
Item header nodes are aligned with an \&{item} struct, which
contains further info about the item.

Each node contains four important fields. Two are the pointers |up|
and |down| of doubly linked lists, already mentioned.
A~third points directly to the item containing the node.
And the last specifies a color, or zero if no color is specified.

A ``pointer'' is an array index, not a \CEE/ reference (because the latter
would occupy 64~bits and waste cache space). The |cl| array is for
\&{item} structs, and the |nd| array is for \&{node}s. I assume that both of
those arrays are small enough to be allocated statically. (Modifications
of this program could do dynamic allocation if needed.)
The header node corresponding to |cl[c]| is |nd[c]|.

Notice that each \&{node} occupies two octabytes.
We count one mem for a simultaneous access to the |up| and |down| fields,
or for a simultaneous access to the |itm| and |color| fields.

Although the item-list pointers are called |up| and |down|, they need not
correspond to actual positions of matrix entries. The elements of
each item list can appear in any order, so that one option
needn't be consistently ``above'' or ``below'' another. Indeed, when
|randomizing| is set, we intentionally scramble each item list.

This program doesn't change the |itm| fields after they've first been set up.
But the |up| and |down| fields will be changed frequently, although preserving
relative order.

Exception: In the node |nd[c]| that is the header for the list of
item~|c|, we use the |itm| field to hold the {\it length\/} of that
list (excluding the header node itself).
We also might use its |color| field for special purposes.
The alternative names |len| for |itm| and |aux| for |color|
are used in the code so that this nonstandard semantics will be more clear.

A {\it spacer\/} node has |itm<=0|. Its |up| field points to the start
of the preceding option; its |down| field points to the end of the following option.
Thus it's easy to traverse an option circularly, in either direction.

The |color| field of a node is set to |-1| when that node has been cleansed.
In such cases its original color appears in the item header.
(The program uses this fact only for diagnostic outputs.)

@d len itm /* item list length (used in header nodes only) */
@d aux color /* an auxiliary quantity (used in header nodes only) */

@<Type...@>=
typedef struct node_struct {
  int up,down; /* predecessor and successor in item list */
  int itm; /* the item containing this node */
  int color; /* the color specified by this node, if any */
} node;

@ Each \&{item} struct contains three fields:
The |name| is the user-specified identifier;
|next| and |prev| point to adjacent items, when this
item is part of a doubly linked list.

As backtracking proceeds, nodes
will be deleted from item lists when their option has been hidden by
other options in the partial solution.
But when backtracking is complete, the data structures will be
restored to their original state.

We count one mem for a simultaneous access to the |prev| and |next| fields.

@*The dancing.
Our strategy for generating all exact covers will be to repeatedly
choose always the item that appears to be hardest to cover, namely the
item with shortest list, from all items that still need to be covered.
And we explore all possibilities via depth-first search.

The neat part of this algorithm is the way the lists are maintained.
Depth-first search means last-in-first-out maintenance of data structures;
and it turns out that we need no auxiliary tables to undelete elements from
lists when backing up. The nodes removed from doubly linked lists remember
their former neighbors, because we do no garbage collection.

The basic operation is ``covering an item.'' This means removing it
from the list of items needing to be covered, and ``hiding'' its
options: removing nodes from other lists whenever they belong to an option of
a node in this item's list.

}

@ When an option is hidden, it leaves all lists except the list of the
item that is being covered. Thus a node is never removed from a list
twice.

We can save time by not removing nodes from secondary items that have been
purified. (Such nodes have |color<0|. Note that |color| and |itm| are
stored in the same octabyte; hence we pay only one mem to look at
them both.)

We could save even more time by not updating the |len| fields of secondary
items. Instead of suppressing that calculation, this program calculates
how much would be saved.

@ I used to think that it was important to uncover an item by
processing its options from bottom to top, since covering was done
from top to bottom. But while writing this
program I realized that, amazingly, no harm is done if the
options are processed again in the same order. So I'll go downward again,
just to prove the point. Whether we go up or down, the pointers
execute an exquisitely choreo\-graphed dance that returns them almost
magically to their former state.

@ During a long run, it's helpful to have some way to measure progress.
The following routine prints a string that indicates roughly where we
are in the search tree. The string consists of character pairs, separated
by blanks, where each character pair represents a branch of the search
tree. When a node has $d$ descendants and we are working on the $k$th,
the two characters respectively represent $k$ and~$d$ in a simple code;
namely, the values 0, 1, \dots, 61 are denoted by
$$\.0,\ \.1,\ \dots,\ \.9,\ \.a,\ \.b,\ \dots,\ \.z,\ \.A,\ \.B,\ \dots,\.Z.$$
All values greater than 61 are shown as `\.*'. Notice that as computation
proceeds, this string will increase lexicographically.

Following that string, a fractional estimate of total progress is computed,
based on the na{\"\i}ve assumption that the search tree has a uniform
branching structure. If the tree consists
of a single node, this estimate is~.5; otherwise, if the first choice
is `$k$ of~$d$', the estimate is $(k-1)/d$ plus $1/d$ times the
recursively evaluated estimate for the $k$th subtree. (This estimate
might obviously be very misleading, in some cases, but at least it
tends to grow monotonically.)
