@*Intro. This program is an experimental {\mc XCC} solver, which
often looks ahead considerably further than {\mc DLX2} does. More precisely, it
maintains ``domain consistency'':
An option $O$ is eliminated when its use would cause some primary item
$I\notin O$ to have no options remaining. In a sense, I'm performing
the work of {\mc DLX-PRE} repeatedly as the search proceeds.
With luck, the total time will decrease, although the time per node
is potentially much larger.

Furthermore, I'm continuing to experiment with sparse-set data structures,
as I did in the similar program {\mc SSXCC},
which was inspired by Christine Solnon's {\mc XCC-WITH-DANCING-CELLS}.

This program was in fact derived directly from {\mc SSXCC}, by adding
further data structures and algorithms. I confess in advance that
the concepts below might not be easy to grasp, because some of them are rather
subtle, and they're just beginning to make sense to me as I put the pieces
together. Hopefully all will become clear
by the time I finish! I've retained the documentation of {\mc SSXCC}'s
features, but they too are admittedly intricate.
So let's take a deep breath together. We can handle this.

The {\mc DLX} input format used in previous solvers is adopted here,
without change, so that fair comparisons can be made.
(See the program {\mc DLX2} for definitions. Much of the code from
that program is used to parse the input for this one.)

@ After this program finds all solutions, it normally prints their total
number on |stderr|, together with statistics about how many
nodes were in the search tree, and how many ``updates'' were made.
The running time in ``mems'' is also reported, together with the approximate
number of bytes needed for data storage.
(An ``update'' is the removal of an option from its item list,
or the removal of a satisfied color constraint from its option.
One ``mem'' essentially means a memory access to a 64-bit word.
The reported totals don't include the time or space needed to parse the
input or to format the output.)

Empirical tests show that this program takes more elapsed time per mem
than most other programs that I've written. I don't know why.
Perhaps it's because the number of ``global registers'' is unusually large.

Here is the overall structure:

@d o mems++ /* count one mem */
@d oo mems+=2 /* count two mems */
@d ooo mems+=3 /* count three mems */
@d subroutine_overhead mems+=4
@d O "%" /* used for percent signs in format strings */

@ You can control the amount of output, as well as certain properties
of the algorithm, by specifying options on the command line:
\smallskip\item{$\bullet$}
`\.v$\langle\,$integer$\,\rangle$' enables or disables various kinds of verbose
 output on |stderr|, given by binary codes such as |show_choices|;
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.m$\langle\,$integer$\,\rangle$' causes every $m$th solution
to be output (the default is \.{m0}, which merely counts them);
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.d$\langle\,$integer$\,\rangle$' sets |delta|, which causes periodic
state reports on |stderr| after the algorithm has performed approximately
|delta| mems since the previous report (default 10000000000);
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.c$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' limits the levels on which
choices are shown during verbose tracing;
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.C$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' limits the levels on which
choices are shown in the periodic state reports;
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.l$\langle\,$nonnegative integer$\,\rangle$' gives a {\it lower\/} limit,
relative to the maximum level so far achieved, to the levels on which
choices are shown during verbose tracing;
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.t$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' causes the program to
stop after this many solutions have been found;
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.T$\langle\,$integer$\,\rangle$' sets |timeout| (which causes abrupt
termination if |mems>timeout| at the beginning of a level);
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.S$\langle\,$filename$\,\rangle$' to output a ``shape file'' that encodes
the search tree;
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.x$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' causes partial solutions of this
many stages to be written to files, not actually explored;
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.X$\langle\,$filename$\,\rangle$' to input and resume a partial solution.

@*Data structures.
Sparse-set data structures were introduced by Preston Briggs
and Linda Torczon [{\sl ACM Letters on Programming Languages and Systems\/
\bf2} (1993), 59--69], who realized that exercise 2.12 in
Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman's classic text {\sl The Design and Analysis
of Computer Algorithms\/} (Addison--Wesley, 1974) was much more than
just a slick trick to avoid initializing an array.
(Indeed, {\sl TAOCP\/} exercise 2.2.6--24 calls it the ``sparse array trick.'')

The basic idea is amazingly simple, when specialized to the situations
that we need to deal with: We can represent a subset~$S$ of the universe
$U=\{x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}\}$ by maintaining two $n$-element arrays
$p$ and $q$, each of which is a permutation of~$\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$,
together with an integer $s$ in the range $0\le s\le n$. In fact, $p$ is
the {\it inverse\/} of~$q$; and $s$ is the number of elements of~$S$.
The current value of the set $S$ is then simply
$\{x_{p_0},\ldots,x_{p_{s-1}}\}$. (Notice that every $s$-element subset can be
represented in $s!\,(n-s)!$ ways.)

It's easy to test if $x_k\in S$, because that's true if and only if $q_k<s$.
It's easy to insert a new element $x_k$ into~$S$: Swap indices
so that $p_s=k$, $q_k=s$, then increase $s$ by~1.
It's easy to delete an element $x_k$ that belongs to~$S$: Decrease $s$
by~1, then swap indices so that $p_s=k$ and $q_k=s$.
And so on.

Briggs and Torczon were interested in applications where $s$ begins at
zero and tends to remain small. In such cases, $p$ and $q$ need not
be permutations: The values of $p_s$, $p_{s+1}$, \dots, $p_{n-1}$ can
be garbage, and the values of $q_k$ need be defined only when $x_k\in S$.
(Such situations correspond to Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman, who started
with an array full of garbage and used a sparse-set structure to remember
the set of nongarbage cells.) Our applications are different: Each set
begins equal to its intended universe, and gradually shrinks. In such
cases, we might as well maintain inverse permutations.
The basic operations go faster when we know in advance that we
aren't inserting an element that's already present (nor deleting an element
that isn't).

Many variations are possible. For example, $p$ could be a permutation
of $\{x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}\}$ instead of a permutation of
$\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$. The arrays that play the role of $q$
in the following routines don't have indices that are consecutive;
they live inside of other structures.

@ This program has an
array called |item|, with one entry for each item. The value of |item[k]|
is an index~|x| into a much larger array called |set|. The set of all
options that involve the $k$th item appears in that array beginning
at |set[x]|; and it continues for $s$ consecutive entries, where |s=size(x)|
is an abbreviation for |set[x-1]|. If |item[k]=x|, we maintain the
relation |pos(x)=k|, where |pos(x)| is an abbreviation for
|set[x-2]|. Thus |item| plays the role of array~$p$, in a
sparse-set data structure for the set of all currently active items;
and |pos| plays the role of~$q$.

Suppose the |k|th item |x| currently appears in |s| options. Those options
are indices into |nd|, which is an array of ``nodes.'' Each node
has four fields: |itm|, |loc|, |clr|, and |xtra|. If |x<=q<x+s|, let |y=set[q]|.
This is essentially a pointer to a node, and we have
|nd[y].itm=x|, |nd[y].loc=q|. In other words,
the sequential list of |s| elements that begins at
|x=item[k]| in the |set| array is the sparse-set representation of the
currently active options that contain the |k|th item.
The |clr| field |nd[y].clr| contains |x|'s color for this option.
The |itm| and |clr| fields remain constant,
once we've initialized everything, but the |loc| fields will change.
The |xtra| field has special uses as we maintain domain consistency,
as explained later.

The given options are stored sequentially in the |nd| array, with one node
per item, separated by ``spacer'' nodes. If |y| is the spacer node
following an option with $t$ items, we have |nd[y].itm=-t|.
If |y| is the spacer node {\it preceding\/} an option with $t$ items,
we have |nd[y].loc=t|.

This probably sounds confusing, until you can see some code.
Meanwhile, let's take note of the invariant relations that hold
whenever |k|, |q|, |x|, and |y| have appropriate values:
$$\hbox{|pos(item[k])=k|;\quad
|nd[set[q]].loc=q|;\quad
|item[pos(x)]=x|;\quad
|set[nd[y].loc]=y|.}$$
(These are the analogs of the invariant relations |p[q[k]]=q[p[k]]=k| in
the simple sparse-set scheme that we started with.)

The |set| array contains also the item names, as well as two
fields |mark(x)| and |match(x)| that are used for compatibility checking.
(The |match| field is present only in secondary items.)

We count one mem for a simultaneous access to the |itm| and |loc| fields
of a node, also one for simultaneous access to |clr| and |xtra|.

@*Domain consistency. The data structures above were fine for {\mc SSXCC},

``domain consistency.'' Several more things are therefore needed.

We regard the given {\mc XCC} problem as a special case of the general binary
{\mc CSP}, in which the variables are the primary items. The domain of primary
item~$p$ is the set of options that contain~$p$. And there's a constraint
between each pair of primary items $p$ and~$p'$: Option $o$ for~$p$ is allowed
together with option $o'$ for~$p'$ if and only if $o$ and $o'$ are
{\it compatible}, in the sense that they're either equal or they have
no items in common, except for secondary items with identical nonzero colors.

What does domain consistency mean in this context?
``For every $p\ne p'$ and every $o$ in the domain
of~$p$, there's a compatible option $o'$ in the domain of~$p'$.''
Stating this another way, suppose $o$ is an option. Then the action
of choosing~$o$, in order to ``cover'' its primary items, must not
``wipe out'' the domain of any primary item that's not in~$o$.

When an option doesn't meet this criterion, we remove it from consideration,
thus simplifying the problem. The removal of an option also makes other options
potentially removable. Eventually we either remove the last option
from some item's domain, in which case there's no solution, or we reach
a stable situation where all domains are nonempty and consistent. 
In the latter case, we'll choose an option, for an item that has
comparatively few of them, and we'll recursively explore the consequences
of either using that option or not.

To maintain domain consistency we shall combine the ideas of Christian
Bessi\`ere's algorithm AC-6 [{\sl Artificial Intelligence\/ \bf65} (1994),
179--190] with Christophe Lecoutre and Fred Hemery's algorithm AC3rm
[{\sl IJCAI Proceedings\/ \bf20} (2007), 125--130], by maintaining a
table of {\it supports}: This program will essentially construct an array
$S[o,p]$, with an element for every option~$o$ and every primary item~$p$,
such that $S[o,p]$ is equal to $o'$ for some compatible option $o'$
such that $p\in o'$,
whenever $p\notin o$;
and $S[o,p]=\#$ when $p\in o$. This array provides witnesses to the
fact that the current domains are indeed consistent.

@ We don't, however, actually represent the support array~$S$ directly.
Instead, we represent the inverse function: For each option~$o'$,
we maintain a list of all the pairs $(o,p)$ such that $S[o,p]=o'$.
This list is called the {\it trigger list\/} of~$o'$, because we use
it to maintain the support conditions: If option~$o'$ is removed
for any reason, thereby leaving one or more holes in the $S$ array, the removal
will trigger a series of events that will refill those holes, one by one.

Each option~$o$ also has a {\it fixit list}, containing all pairs $(o',p)$
for which the event $(o,p)$ has been triggered by~$o'$ but the corresponding
hole hasn't yet been refilled.

There's also a queue~$Q$, containing all the options~$o$ for which
at least one hole currently exists.

All of these lists --- the triggers,
the fixits, and the queue --- are singly linked, in a array called |pool|,
whose elements have two fields called |info| and |link| in familiar fashion.
The trigger lists and fixit lists are stacks (last-in-first-out);
the queue is first-in-first-out.

@ Internally, an option~$o$ is represented by the index of the
spacer just preceding that option in~|nd|. An item~$i$, whether primary
or secondary, is represented
by the index where the main data for~$I$ appears in |set|.
A link is represented by its index in |pool|.

Variables |qfront| and |qrear| are the indices of the front and rear
of~$Q$. More precisely, |qfront| points to the front element, the node
that will be removed first; |qrear| points to a ``blank'' node that
follows the element that will be removed last. The queue is empty
if and only if |qfront=qrear|. The contents of |info(qrear)| and |link(qrear)|
are both irrelevant; they will be filled in when a new element is enqueued
and a new blank element is appended.

Fortunately there's room enough in the existing data structures of
program {\mc SSXCC} to store the two pointers that we need for each
option: The top of |o|'s trigger stack, called |trigger(o)|, is
kept in location |nd[o].clr|; and the top of |o|'s fixit stack,
called |fixit(o)|, is kept in |nd[o].xtra|. We have |fixit(o)=0| if and only
if $o$~is not in the queue.

We'll see later than every inactive option has an |age|, indicating when
it was purged from the current partial solution. This value, |age(o)|
appears in |nd[o+1].xtra|.

(Kludge note: With these conventions, all of an option's dynamic data has been
squeezed into the three otherwise unused fields |nd[o].clr|, |nd[o].xtra|,
and |nd[o+1].xtra|. If another special datum had been
needed, I could have put it into |nd[o+1].clr|,
because this program ensures that every option begins with a primary item.)

@ Linked lists are wonderful; but a single weak link can cause a
catastrophic error. Therefore, when debugging, I want to be extra sure that this
program doesn't make any silly errors when it uses pool pointers.

Furthermore, since I'm doing my own garbage collection, I want to avoid
any ``memory leaks'' that would occur when I've forgotten to recycle
a no-longer-used entry of the |pool|.

The |list_check| routine laboriously goes through everything and makes
sure that every cell less than |poolptr| currently has one and only one use.

Warning: Do not call |list_check| at a busy time during which lists
are being manipulated. Wait for a quiet time when all of the lists
are supposedly stable and well-formed.

@ One of our main activities is to find options $O'$ that are compatible
with a given option~$O$. We do this by marking each item $I$ of~$O$
with |compatstamp|, and also recording $I$'s color if $I$ is secondary.
Then, given a candidate $O'$, we can easily spot incompatibility.

That idea works when $I\in O$ is equivalent to |mark(I)==compatstamp|.
So we start with all |mark| fields equal to zero; and we increase
|compatstamp| by~1 whenever starting this process with a new~$O$.

But there's a hitch: If this testing is done $2^{32}$ times, |compatstamp|
will ``wrap around'' to zero, and our test might be invalid.
In such a case we can still guarantee success if we take the trouble to
zero out all the |mark| fields again.

middle of some option~$O'$. If $O'$ is compatible with |opt|, we want to

@*Maintaining supports. It's time now to implement some of the mechanisms
used for the ``virtual support array~$S$'' described earlier.

First, let's see what happens when an option goes away. The value
returned is 0 if this was the final option for some primary item.
Otherwise the option's trigger list will enqueue fixits, to
provide replacements for any supports that are no longer valid.

When |opt_out| deactivates an option, it sets that option's ``age''
to |cur_age|, which measures our progress to a complete solution.
Options that are purged early, on the basis of fewer assumptions,
are ``younger'' than options that are purged later.

We'll see later that a trigger list may contain hints about the ages
of its entries. Such hints are signalled by negative entries.

The |opt_out| procedure rearranges the entries of a long trigger
list by carrying out a ``bucket sort,'' which puts
the youngest remaining entries last.
This sorting process uses auxiliary arrays |trig_head|
and |trig_tail|; |trig_head| is assumed to be zero upon entry and exit.

@*A view from the top.
Our strategy for generating all exact covers will be to repeatedly
choose an item that appears to be hardest to cover, namely an item whose set
is currently smallest, among all items that still need to be covered.
And we explore all possibilities via depth-first search, in the
following way: First we try using the first option in that item's set;
then we explore the consequences of {\it forbidding\/} that item.

The neat part of this algorithm is the way the sets are maintained.
Depth-first search means last-in-first-out maintenance of data structures;
and the sparse-set representations make it particularly easy to undo
what we've done at less-deep levels.

The basic operation is ``covering'' each item of a chosen option.
Covering means to make an item inactive. If it is primary, we remove it
from the set of items needing to be covered, and we block all other
options that contain it. If the item is secondary and still active
(not yet purified), we block all options in which it has the wrong color.

The branching discipline that we follow is quite different from what we
did in {\mc DLX2} or {\mc SSXCC}, however, because we're now maintaining
domain consistency throughout the search. The old way was to choose a
``best item''~$p$, having say~$d$ options, and then to try option 1 of the
$d$~possibilities for~$p$, then option 2 of those~$d$, \dots,
option $d$ of those~$d$, before backtracking to the previous level.

The new way, given consistent domains, starts out the same as before.
We choose a best item~$p_1$, having $d_1$ options, and we try its
first option. But after returning from that branch, we remove that
option and restore domain consistency; then we choose a new best item~$p_2$,
having $d_2$ options, and try the first of those. Eventually, after
trying and removing the first remaining options of $p_1$ through~$p_k$,
we'll reach a point where we can't make the remaining domains both
consistent and nonempty. That's when we back up.

In this scenario, all of the subproblems for $p_1$, \dots, $p_k$ are
trying to extend the same partial solution with $s$ choices to a
partial solution that has $s+1$ choices. We call this ``stage $s$''
of the search. Stage $s$ actually involves $k$ different nodes of
the (binary) search tree, each of which is on its own ``level.''
(The level is the distance from the root; the stage is the number
of options that have been chosen in the current partial solution.)

We might think of the search as a tree that makes a $k$-way branch
at stage~$s$, instead of as a tree that makes binary branches at each level.
Such an interpretation is equivalent to the ``natural correspondence'' between
ordinary trees and binary trees, discussed in {\sl TAOCP\/} Section 2.3.2.

@ As search proceeds, the current subproblem gets easier and easier
as the number of active items and options gets smaller and smaller.
Let $I_s$ be the set of all items that are active when $s$ options
$c_1$, \dots,~$c_s$
have been chosen to be in the partial solution-so-far. Thus $I_0$ is
the set of all items initially given; and $I_s$ for $s>0$ is obtained
from $I_{s-1}$ by removing the primary items and the previously
unpurified secondary items of~$c_s$. We denote the primary items of~$I_s$
by $P_s$; these are the primary items not in $c_1$, \dots,~$c_s$.

Let $O_{-1}$ be the set of all options actually given. Just before
entering stage~0, we reduce $O_{-1}$ to
\def\init{^{\rm init}}%
$O_0\init$, the largest subset of $O_{-1}$ that is domain consistent,
by purging options that have no support. In general, stage~$s$
begins with a domain-consistent set of options $O_s\init$,
which is the largest such set that's compatible with $c_1$, \dots,~$c_s$.
Later on in stage~$s$ we usually work with a smaller set of active
options $O_s$, which is the largest domain-consistent set that's
contained in $O_s\init$ after we've removed the options whose
consequences as potential choices were previously examined in this stage.

If every item in $P_s$ still belongs to at least one option of~$O_s$,
we're ready to make a new~$c_{s+1}$ from among those remaining
options. We get $O_{s+1}\init$ from $O_s$ by choosing $c_{s+1}$ and
blocking every option incompatible with it,
and then by purging options that aren't domain-consistent.

Thus when we're in stage~$s$, there's a sequence of sets of options
$$O_{-1}\supseteq O_0\init \supseteq O_0
     \supset O_1\init \supseteq O_1\supset\cdots\supset
               O_s\init \supseteq O_s,$$
all of which are domain consistent except possibly $O_{-1}$.
Notice that
$$\hbox{if $o\in O_s\init$ and $p\in o$ then $p\in P_s$.}$$

And there's good news:
The support array $S[o,p]$ follows the nested structure of our search in
a useful way. Recall that $S[o,p]=\#$ if $p\in o$; otherwise
$S[o,p]=o'$, where $p\in o'$ and $o'$ is compatible with~$o$.

This array is defined for all options $o\in O_0\init$, and for
all primary items $p\in P_0$. However, when we enter stage~$s$,
we're interested only in the much smaller subarray that contains
supports when $o\in O_s\init$ and $p\in P_s$. And when we're transitioning
from stage~$s$ to stage~$s+1$, we care only about a
still-smaller subarray, for $o\in O_s$ and $p\in P_s$. In particular,
domain consistency implies that we have
$$\eqalign{
&\hbox{if $o\in O_s\init$ and $p\notin o$ and $p\in P_s$ then }
  S[o,p]\in O_s\init;\cr
&\hbox{if $o\in O_s$ and $p\notin o$ and $p\in P_s$ then }
  S[o,p]\in O_s.\cr}$$

@ Eventually a choice will fail, of course. Backtracking becomes
necessary in two distinct ways: \ (1)~If we've settled on a new~$c_s$
among the options of $O_s$, but we're unable to reduce the remaining
compatible options to a domain-consistent $O_{s+1}\init$ without
emptying some domain, we ``backtrack in stage~$s$'' and reject that choice.
(Thus, we stay in stage~$s$ but move to a new level; the active items
remain the same.) \ (2)~If we've finished exploring a choice from $O_s$
and are unable to reduce the other options to a smaller
domain-consistent~$O_s$, we ``backtrack to stage~$s-1$'' and reject~$c_{s-1}$.
(Thus, we resume where we left off at the previous
stage's deepest level; the active items revert back from $P_s$
to the larger set~$P_{s-1}$.)

I wish I could say that it was easy for me to discover the programming
logic just described. I~guess it was my baptism into what researchers
have called ``fine-grained'' versus ``coarse-grained'' algorithms.

Notice that when we backtrack, we need not change the $S$ array in any way.
A support is always a support. Thus there's no point in trying to undo
any of the changes we've made to the current support structure.

@*The triggering.
Suppose there are 1000 options and 100 items. Then the $S$ array has
100,000 entries, most of which are supports (that is, not~\#).
Every support is an entry in a trigger list; hence the trigger lists
are necessarily long. The task of maintaining domain consistency
might therefore seem hopelessly inefficient.

On the other hand, after we've made some choices, there may be only 100
options left, and perhaps 30 items not yet covered. Then at most 3000
supports are relevant, and most of the information in trigger lists
is of no interest to us. An efficient scheme might therefore still
be possible, if we can figure out a way to avoid looking at useless
triggers.

Ideally we'd like options from $O_s$ to appear at the top of each trigger
stack, with options from $O_s\init$ just below them, and with
$O_{s-1}$, $O_{s-1}\init$, \dots, $O_0$, $O_0\init$ furthest down.
The pairs $(o,p)$ of interest would then appear only near the top.

Unfortunately such an arrangement cannot be guaranteed. Indeed, that's
obvious: The trigger-list entries occur in essentially arbitrary order
when we first form $O_0\init$. If they happen to be supports that
work for every subsequent stage, no changes to the trigger lists will
be needed, and we won't even want to look at those lists.

We can, however, come sort of close to an ideal arrangement, by
exploiting the fact that every option not in the current $O_s$ has
been deactivated at least once. We look at \\{trigger}$(o)$ only after
$o$~has become inactive; and at that time we can reorder its entries.

Therefore this program inserts markers into the trigger lists, saying that
``all further entries of this list are young'' (meaning deactivated early,
hence uninteresting until we've backtracked to an early stage).
Every such marker is accompanied by a time stamp, so that
we can recognize later when its message is no longer~true.

@ When deactivating an option from $O_s\init$ that won't be in~$O_s$,
the ``current age'' |cur_age| is $2s$. And when deactivating an
option from $O_s$ that won't be in~$O_{s+1}\init$ it is $2s+1$.

Thus an inactive option is in $O_s\init$ if and only if its age is $\ge2s$;
and it's in $O_s$ if and only if its age is $\ge2s+1$.

Incidentally, I've tried to avoid making bad puns based on |cur_age|
versus courage, or \\{age} versus~\\{stage}.

@ A negative entry |optp=-c| in a trigger list is a hint that all future
entries will have age less than~$c$. The search tree may have changed
since this hint was put into the list; so we must look at the relevant
stage stamp, to ensure that the hint is still valid.

Suppose $o$ has age $2s$. Then $o$ is in $O_s\init$ but not in $O_s$. As
computation proceeds, without backtracking to stage~$s-1$, the set
$O_s$ might get smaller and smaller, but $o$ will still not be in~$O_s$.
Therefore a trigger hint saying that $o$ is inactive will be valid
until |stagestamp[s]| changes. (More precisely: If we backtrack to
stage~$s-1$, |stagestamp[s]| won't change until we progress again
to stage~$s$; before that time, we won't be looking at the hint.)

Suppose $o$ has age $2s+1$. Then $o$ is in $O_s$ but not in $O_{s+1}\init$. As
computation proceeds, without backtracking in or to stage~$s$, the set
$O_{s+1}\init$ won't change.
Therefore a trigger hint saying that $o$ is inactive will be valid
until |stagestamp[s+1]| changes.

That's why the following code says `|(cutoff+1)>>1|' when selecting the
relevant stage stamp.

@<If all remaining triggers are known to be inactive...@>=
{
  cutoff=-optp-1;
  if (cutoff<cur_age && (o,ii==stagestamp[(cutoff+1)>>1])) {
    pp=p;
    break;
  }
  putavail(p),putavail(q); /* discard an obsolete hint */
  continue; /* and ignore it */
}

@ If |optp| is inactive, it has been purged and its recorded
age is |cur_age| or less. Thus we can conclude that |optp| is active
whenever |age(optp)>cur_age|.

In general, of course, that age test won't be conclusive and a slightly
more expensive test needs to be made by looking further into the data
structures. Option |optp| is active if and only if
it appears in the current set of its first item.
(This is where we use the fact that the first item of |optp| is primary.)

@<If |optp| has been deactivated, set |t| to its age and |goto inactive|@>=
o,t=age(optp);
if (t<=cur_age) {
  o,jj=nd[optp+1].itm; /* |jj| is |optp|'s first item */
  if (o,nd[optp+1].loc>=jj+size(jj)) goto inactive;
} /* branch if |optp| was removed from |jj|'s set */

@ When the trigger list for |opt| refers to an item |ii|, that item
is in |opt|. Suppose |ii| is currently inactive; then we wouldn't be purging
|opt| unless |ii| has just become inactive (and we're calling |opt_out|
from within |include_option|).

@<If |ii| isn't active, set |t=cur_age| and |goto inactive|@>=
if (o,pos(ii)>=active) {
  if (pos(ii)>=act) confusion("active");
  t=cur_age;
  goto inactive;
}

@ When we get here, |pp| is either zero or the cell where we found |cutoff|.
In the latter case, |pp=p| and |link(p)=q|; thus the cutoff hint
is in |p| and~|q|.

All of the unused trigger entries have been redirected to the |trig_head|
lists, sorted by their age.

@<Replace |trigger(opt)| by its unused entries, reordered and hinted@>=
if (pp==0) cutoff=-1;
if (tmin<=cutoff) {
  if (tmin<cutoff) confusion("trig");
  o,pp=link(q),putavail(p),putavail(q); /* avoid double hint */
}
for (t=tmin;t<cur_age;t++) if (o,trig_head[t]) {
  oo,link(trig_tail[t])=pp;
  o,p=getavail(),q=getavail(),link(p)=q; /* make new hint */
  o,info(p)=-t-1;
  oo,info(q)=stagestamp[(t+1)>>1],link(q)=trig_head[t];
  o,trig_head[t]=0;
  pp=p;
}
if (trig_head[cur_age]) {
  oo,link(trig_tail[cur_age])=pp;
     /* give no hint for inactive options of the current age */
  o,pp=trig_head[cur_age],trig_head[cur_age]=0;
}  
o,trigger(opt)=pp;

@ @<Print a trigger hint@>=
{
  fprintf(stderr,"cutoff for age "O"d",-info(p)-1);
  if (info(q)!=stagestamp[(-info(p))>>1]) fprintf(stderr," (obsolete)");
}

@ At this point we want |curstamp| to have a value that's larger
than anything found in a trigger list~hint. Moreover, the values
of |stagestamp[0]|, \dots, |stagestamp[stage-1]| should all be
distinct and less than |curstamp|, because they might be used
in future hints.

We may not be able to satisfy those conditions when |badstamp| is a
small positive constant! But we will
have checked out the following code at least once before failing.

@<Bump |curstamp|@>=
if (++biggeststamp==badstamp) {
  if (badstamp>0 && stage>=badstamp) {

@ An item becomes inactive when it becomes part of the solution-so-far
(hence it leaves the problem-that-remains). Active primary items are those
that haven't yet been covered. Active secondary items are those that
haven't yet been purified.

The active items are the first |active| entries of the |item| list. At one
time I thought it would be wise to keep primary and secondary items separate, using a
sparse-set discipline independently on each sector. But I found that the
time spent in maintaining and searching the active list was negligible
in comparison with the overall running time; so I've kept the implementation simple.

At this point in the computation, an item of |opt| will be inactive
if and only if it is secondary
and purified, because we are including |opt| in the partial solution.

@<Inactivate all items of |opt|...@>=
p=oactive=active;
for (q=opt+1;o,(c=nd[q].itm)>0;q++) {
  o,pp=pos(c);
  if (pp<p) { /* |c| is active */
    o,cc=item[--p];
    oo,item[p]=c,item[pp]=cc;
    if (c>=second) oo,match(c)=nd[q].clr;
    oo,pos(cc)=pp,pos(c)=p;
    updates++;
  }
}
active=p;

@ This program differs from {\mc SSXCC} in one significant way: It makes
option |opt| inactive. In particular, it makes all of |opt|'s items
have size~0, except for unpurified secondaries. (Thus, we essentially say that
newly assigned variables---the inactivated primary items---should have
empty domains when they leave the current subproblem, while {\mc SSXCC}
left them with domains of size~1.)

It would be a mistake to call |opt_out(opt,oactive)|, of course,
because that procedure doesn't want any primary items to become optionless.
On the contrary, we have precisely the opposite goal: We {\it celebrate\/} the
fact that all of the primaries in |opt| have become covered.

We don't have to change |trigger(opt)|, because no active options
involve inactive primary items.

@<Make |opt| itself inactive@>=

@ The ``best item'' is considered to be an item that minimizes the
number of remaining choices. If there are several candidates, we
choose the first one that we encounter.

Each primary item should have at least one valid choice, because
of domain consistency.

@ During a long run, it's helpful to have some way to measure progress.
The following routine prints a string that indicates roughly where we
are in the search tree. The string consists of node degrees,
preceded by `\.{\char`\~}' if the node wasn't the current node in
its stage (that is, if the node represents an option that has already
been fully explored --- ``we've been there done that'').

Following that string, a fractional estimate of total progress is computed,
based on the na{\"\i}ve assumption that the search tree has a uniform
branching structure. If the tree consists
of a single node, this estimate is~.5. Otherwise, if the first choice
is the $k$th choice in stage~0 and has degree~$d$,
the estimate is $(k-1)/(d+k-1)$ plus $1/(d+k-1)$ times the
recursively evaluated estimate for the $k$th subtree. (This estimate
might obviously be very misleading, in some cases, but at least it
tends to grow monotonically.)

Fine point: If we've just backtracked within stage |stage|,
the string of node degrees with end with a `\.{\char`\~}' entry,
and we haven't yet made {\it any\/} choice in the current~stage.
The test `|l==level-1|' below uses the fact that |levelstage[stage]=level|
to adjust the fractional estimate appropriately for the partial
progress in the current stage.
